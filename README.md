Abstract

Being an auditor for the Advanced Data Analytics Class and at the same time full/time employees at Credit Suisse AG, we would like to propose a project that would allow us to put into practise the skills taught in the class within a project bringing value also to our company.

The goal of the proposed project is to look for and represent an eventual relation between Credit Suisse AG (CS) option price and external events.

Data description

We intend to use various datasets including News and Announcements mainly from Switzerland, but also from the globe. Financial Reports and results published by the bank and other players in the financial sector. In addition, we would like to analyse opinions and statements from the social networks about CS and the Financial Sector in general. In this context, twitter and Instagram datasets would be studied. Furthermore, we would like to investigate the possibility of using data from Glassdoor to enrich external view of the company. Google trends data will also be used to support the time series analysis which is a part of the project. Finally, we could incorporate rss feeds from SIX or Reuters either from an external available dataset or from an internal source; the potentiality of this proposal requires further investigation.

In order to achieve the above mentioned goal, we are going to perform a Time Series analysis with the ultimate aim of detecting some trends. Moreover, we are going to use several NLP techniques suitable for textual analysis for name entities recognition and sentiment analysis.

Feasibility and Risks

In our proposal we are naming several data sources, however there is a chance that we are not in position of using all of them, either because we do not get access to the data, or because of limitations in the available data time range. 

Deliverables

A set of visualisations reflecting the main findings and a document that would describe the procedure and any design decisions taken.

Timeplan

Checkpoint and primary results will be provided by the end of December (19th-23rd) due to the expected high load at work.
Final results will be presented by the end of January
